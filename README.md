Aim of the Game:
- The aim of the game is to try and kill all of the monsters on the map as fast as possible without dying.

Controls:
- use the WASD keys to move Up Down Left and Right around the map.
- use the 'J' key to deal damage to the closest enemy if they are in range.
- use the 'H' key to slowly heal your health back to max, however, you cannot move while healing so watch out for monsters!
- If you die, Press the 'R' key to reset the game and try again.

Helpful Info:
- If you get too close while trying to attack a monster, the damage you deal to it will also be dealt to you as 
the monster deflects your attack
- Monsters are also posionous and will damage you consistently if you get too close. They will also leave a poisonous essence in their place of death that will damage you as you walk through it.
- Because damage is based on the event loop, trying to heal next to a monster will only make you die quicker! Avoid it at all costs!
- If you get too far while trying to attack you wont be able to deal any damage and your hit wont land.
- As you kill more monsters your experince level will increase, making you deal more damage to other monsters.
- once you have killed all the monsters press the 'r' key to try again and do it a bit faster!
